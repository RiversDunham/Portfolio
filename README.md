# Portfolio
I am an aspiring game developer who finds interest in all things tech. Iâ€™ve dabbled in multiple different coding languages and coding environments. And experimented in creating my own music, art, sprites, 3D models, and animations, to achieve my dream to solely create my own indie game.

I (will) have a certification from Mountainland Technical College for Software Quality Assurance where I have learned many skills.
